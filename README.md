HydroCtrl is a distributed system for hydroponics automation.

##### Open platform for flexible hydroponics automation
</div>

# HydroCtrl
HydroCtrl is a open software platform that enables people to build cost effective hydroponics automation and monitoring systems.
Idea is to provide a server and API so users can create IOT-nodes that senses and controls variables in hydroponics.
HydroCtrl also provide an UI so users can configure and monitor their systems.

## User interface

## Server
Just build and run the server in same network as nodes.

## IOT-nodes
We are currently working on creating nodes for the most common tasks.
Users can create their own nodes using a simple API.
