# HydroCtrl
HydroCtrl enables people to build cost effective hydroponics automation and monitoring systems using opensource software and hardware.
HydroCtrl is basically a client and a communication protocol so users can build nodes that communicate with HydroCtrl client.
Each node controls some greenhouse variable such as PH, CO2 or a simple relay that controls a fan.
Client communicates with nodes trough wifi.
