# HydroCntrl
Scalable and fully open hydroponics monitoring system.
Everything from UI to hardware and between.
Time to make advanced hydroponics accessible to everyone.

## Design
HydroCntrl is composed of three main compoments:
- Client 
- Server 
- Hardware

Client is the UI.
Server is the middleman between client and hardware.
Hardware reads sensors, controls pumps etc.

Biggest benefits of a RPI as an server is that we can record video and store large amount of data from hardware.
